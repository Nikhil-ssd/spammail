#### Problem Statement
The classification task is to determine whether a given email is spam or not.

#### Purpose of the solving this problem

The purpose of solving a classification task to determine if an email is spam or not is to improve the efficiency and security of email communication. Here's a breakdown of the key objectives:

Filtering Unwanted Emails: The primary goal is to identify and filter out spam emails, which are unsolicited and often irrelevant, from a user's inbox. This improves user experience by reducing clutter and allowing users to focus on important emails.

Reducing Security Risks: Many spam emails contain phishing attempts, malware, or other harmful content. An effective spam classification system helps protect users from these security risks by automatically segregating harmful emails from legitimate ones.

Automating the Email Management Process: Manually identifying and deleting spam emails can be time-consuming. A well-trained spam classifier automates this process, saving users time and effort.

Improving Business Productivity: In organizational settings, spam emails can overwhelm employee inboxes, reducing productivity. Spam classification ensures that important business communications are not lost in the flood of unsolicited emails.

Efficient Resource Use: For email service providers, effectively classifying and filtering spam helps conserve bandwidth, storage, and other computing resources, since fewer spam messages are processed or stored unnecessarily.

In short, solving this classification task helps enhance user experience, improves security, and reduces time and resource costs associated with managing emails.
